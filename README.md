## Minimum
This is minimal Android application written whithout IDE, in a simple text editor and compiled in command line.
It's goal is to understand how to create Android application from scratch, its structure, and necessary tools.

[TwoWayView](https://github.com/lucasr/twoway-view) is a view library extending RecyclerView.  
It has SpannableGridLayoutManager in its code and allows you to build spannable grids.  
This app is demonstrating such kind of layout. It's just like Snapchat Discover gallery with random photos and random titles.
